# Python - Environment & First Programs


## Introduction & Context
Python can execute code in two primary ways:

Interactively, using the interpreter (REPL).
By executing a script file.
Professional software development requires understanding both execution modes, how tools are installed, and how environments influence behavior.

This project builds a structured mental model:

How the interpreter evaluates expressions and statements.
How a script differs from interactive execution.
How development tools are installed using pip.
Why global installations can create conflicts.
How virtual environments isolate dependencies.


## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Distinguish between expressions and statements in the interpreter.
Predict when output will appear automatically in interactive mode.
Create a portable, executable Python script.
Install and use a development tool via pip.
Explain the difference between global installations and isolated environments.
Demonstrate dependency isolation using venv.

## General Requirements
Corrections will run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Python version used for correction: Python 3.8.x.
Every Python file must start exactly with:
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
Every Python file must:
Be executable.
End with a newline.
Be PEP8 compliant (pycodestyle 2.7.x).
Output must match expected formatting exactly.
No external libraries are allowed unless explicitly requested.
